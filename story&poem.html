    <p style="font-size: large;">
        In the late 18th century, smallpox was a deadly disease that claimed millions of lives across Europe. 
        Amidst this crisis, an English doctor named Edward Jenner made a groundbreaking discovery that would 
        change the course of medical history.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: large;">
        Jenner observed that milkmaids who had previously contracted cowpox—a much milder disease—seemed immune 
        to smallpox. Cowpox caused blisters similar to smallpox but was not life-threatening. Curious about this 
        connection, Jenner hypothesized that exposure to cowpox could protect a person from smallpox.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: large;">
        On May 14, 1796, Jenner tested his theory. He took pus from the cowpox sores of a milkmaid named Sarah 
        Nelmes and inoculated an eight-year-old boy named James Phipps. The boy developed mild symptoms but 
        recovered quickly. Several weeks later, Jenner exposed James to the smallpox virus. Remarkably, the boy 
        did not develop the disease.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: large;">
        Jenner repeated the experiment on several others and observed the same results. He named the procedure 
        “vaccination,” derived from vacca, the Latin word for cow. Despite skepticism from some in the medical 
        community, Jenner’s findings gained recognition and laid the foundation for modern immunology.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: large;">
        The success of Jenner’s vaccine led to widespread adoption, and by the 20th century, vaccination campaigns 
        had drastically reduced smallpox cases worldwide. In 1980, the World Health Organization declared smallpox 
        officially eradicated.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: large;">
        Edward Jenner’s work not only saved countless lives but also introduced the concept of using weakened or 
        related viruses to protect against deadly diseases—an idea still central to vaccines today.

    <p style="font-size: larger; text-align: center;">
        Hold fast to dreams <br>
        For if dreams die <br>
        Life is a broken-winged bird <br>
        That cannot fly. <br><br>

        Hold fast to dreams <br>
        For when dreams go <br>
        Life is a barren field <br>
        Frozen with snow.
